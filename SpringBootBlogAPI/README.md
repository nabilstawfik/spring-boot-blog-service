Develop a RESTful API for a Blog System.

    The API must provide the following functionality:
    Create authors (a simple nickname is sufficient)
    Create a Blog post (with title, text, author)
    Update title and/or text of a Blog post
    Retrieve a list of blog posts, sorted by creation time (latest first)
    
Create a simple browser based UI (does not need to be pretty) that mimics a blog system showing all the functionality of the above mentioned API.

Hints:
    An in-memory database is totally fine for persistence.
    You can choose whatever programming language or framework you like, though our preferred tech stack is based on Spring (Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA/MongoDB/REST).
    We will focus on API design and software architecture.
    Signs of DDD and TDD are a plus.
